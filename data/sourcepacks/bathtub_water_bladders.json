    "Explain that bathtub bladders are for short-term emergencies (days to weeks) and defer to manufacturer guidance on max duration",
    "Quantify water weight and typical bathtub volumes (8.34 lb/gal; 50–80 gal common) and note structure support is generally better under tubs",
    "Stress single-use liners and contamination risks: only fill with potable tap water from a safe supply",
    "Clear setup steps: clean tub surface, inspect liner, fit fill hose, protect against stopper/overflow issues, keep pets/children out",
    "Highlight that bladders are not a rotation solution; pair with containers or bottled water for the ladder (72h→2w→30d+)",
    "Provide at least 3 authoritative sources and one lived-experience/forum insight",
    "Include disposal guidance and post-event sanitization of tub"
